        "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries is React. React is a widely adopted library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It has gained popularity due to its component-based architecture, virtual DOM rendering, and the ability to efficiently update and manage UI components. React has a vast ecosystem with a large community, offering numerous additional libraries, tools, and resources for developers. However, please note that popularity among JavaScript libraries can change over time, so it's always a good idea to stay updated with the latest trends and developments in the JavaScript ecosystem."
